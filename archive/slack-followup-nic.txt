Hey Nic! Great sync today 🙌

Quick recap + action items for tomorrow:

—

**What I'm sending you tonight:**
• Screen inventory (all screens that need design)
• Design tokens guide (how variables map to code)

**What I need from you (Dec 4):**
• Screenshot current dev → bring into new Figma page
• Feedback with specifics (px sizes, spacing, text changes)
• Font files exported (Metro Sans + Moret as .woff2 or .otf)
• Component states (hover, active, disabled)
• Source files for assets (SVG for icons, not images)

—

**Decisions locked in:**
✓ JotForm for V1 assessment → email w/ branded PDF as end state
✓ Chat design = Claude style (AI transparent, user in 60% white bubble)
✓ Desktop-first, then responsive

—

**Resources on the Figma → Code workflow:**

1. **Figma MCP for Claude** — This is what I'm using to pull your designs directly into code:

2. **How Figma Dev Mode works with AI tools** — Good overview of the design-to-dev handoff:

The key thing: when you define variables consistently in Figma (colors, spacing, fonts), I can extract them automatically. No more "what hex is that?" back-and-forth.

I'll be online all day tomorrow for check-ins. Just ping me when you have something ready to review.

Let's get that golden standard locked 🔒
